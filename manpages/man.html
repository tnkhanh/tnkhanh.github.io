<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
man is the system&rsquo;s manual pager. Each page argument
given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or
function. The manual page associated with each of <br>
these arguments is then found and displayed. A section, if
provided, will direct man to look only in that section of
the manual. The default action is to search <br>
in all of the available sections following a pre-defined
order (&quot;1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6
7&quot; by default, unless overridden by the SECTION
directive <br>
in /etc/manpath.config), and to show only the first page
found, even if page exists in several sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The table below shows the
section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages
they contain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Executable programs or shell
commands <br>
2 System calls (functions provided by the kernel) <br>
3 Library calls (functions within program libraries) <br>
4 Special files (usually found in /dev) <br>
5 File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd <br>
6 Games <br>
7 Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions),
e.g. man(7), groff(7) <br>
8 System administration commands (usually only for root)
<br>
9 Kernel routines [Non standard]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A manual page consists of
several sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conventional section names
include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS,
EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT, FILES,
VERSIONS, CONFORM&acirc; <br>
ING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following conventions apply
to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bold text type exactly as shown.
<br>
italic text replace with appropriate argument. <br>
[-abc] any or all arguments within [ ] are optional. <br>
-a|-b options delimited by | cannot be used together. <br>
argument ... argument is repeatable. <br>
[expression] ... entire expression within [ ] is
repeatable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exact rendering may vary
depending on the output device. For instance, man will
usually not be able to render italics when running in a
terminal, and will typi&acirc; <br>
cally use underlined or coloured text instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command or function
illustration is a pattern that should match all possible
invocations. In some cases it is advisable to illustrate
several exclusive invo&acirc; <br>
cations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
man ls <br>
Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man man.7 <br>
Display the manual page for macro package man from section
7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man -a intro <br>
Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual
pages contained within the manual. It is possible to quit
between successive displays or skip any of <br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man -t alias | lpr -Pps <br>
Format the manual page referenced by &lsquo;alias&rsquo;,
usually a shell manual page, into the default troff or groff
format and pipe it to the printer named ps. The de&acirc;
<br>
fault output for groff is usually PostScript. man --help
should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz &gt;
./foo.1x.dvi <br>
This command will decompress and format the nroff source
manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi)
file. The redirection is necessary as the -T <br>
flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.
The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or
further processed into PostScript using a <br>
program such as dvips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man -k printf <br>
Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the
keyword printf as regular expression. Print out any matches.
Equivalent to apropos printf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man -f smail <br>
Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out
the short descriptions of any found. Equivalent to whatis
smail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
Many options are available to man in order to give as much
flexibility as possible to the user. Changes can be made to
the search path, section order, output pro&acirc; <br>
cessor, and other behaviours and operations detailed
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set, various environment
variables are interrogated to determine the operation of
man. It is possible to set the &lsquo;catch all&rsquo;
variable $MANOPT to any string in <br>
command line format with the exception that any spaces used
as part of an option&rsquo;s argument must be escaped
(preceded by a backslash). man will parse $MANOPT <br>
prior to parsing its own command line. Those options
requiring an argument will be overridden by the same options
found on the command line. To reset all of the <br>
options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial
command line option. This will allow man to
&lsquo;forget&rsquo; about the options specified in $MANOPT
although <br>
they must still have been valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The manual pager utilities
packaged as man-db make extensive use of index database
caches. These caches contain information such as where each
manual page can be <br>
found on the filesystem and what its whatis (short one line
description of the man page) contains, and allow man to run
faster than if it had to search the <br>
filesystem each time to find the appropriate manual page. If
requested using the -u option, man will ensure that the
caches remain consistent, which can obviate <br>
the need to manually run software to update traditional
whatis text databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If man cannot find a mandb
initiated index database for a particular manual page
hierarchy, it will still search for the requested manual
pages, although file <br>
globbing will be necessary to search within that hierarchy.
If whatis or apropos fails to find an index it will try to
extract information from a traditional <br>
whatis database instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These utilities support
compressed source nroff files having, by default, the
extensions of .Z, .z and .gz. It is possible to deal with
any compression extension, <br>
but this information must be known at compile time. Also, by
default, any cat pages produced are compressed using gzip.
Each &lsquo;global&rsquo; manual page hierarchy such <br>
as /usr/share/man or /usr/X11R6/man may have any directory
as its cat page hierarchy. Traditionally the cat pages are
stored under the same hierarchy as the man <br>
pages, but for reasons such as those specified in the File
Hierarchy Standard (FHS), it may be better to store them
elsewhere. For details on how to do this, <br>
please read manpath(5). For details on why to do this, read
the standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">International support is
available with this package. Native language manual pages
are accessible (if available on your system) via use of
locale functions. To <br>
activate such support, it is necessary to set either
$LC_MESSAGES, $LANG or another system dependent environment
variable to your language locale, usually speci&acirc; <br>
fied in the POSIX 1003.1 based format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;[.&lt;character-set&gt;[,&lt;version&gt;]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the desired page is available
in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard
(usually American English) page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for international
message catalogues is also featured in this package and can
be activated in the same way, again if available. If you
find that the man&acirc; <br>
ual pages and message catalogues supplied with this package
are not available in your native language and you would like
to supply them, please contact the main&acirc; <br>
tainer who will be coordinating such activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information regarding other
features and extensions available with this manual pager,
please read the documents supplied with the package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
man will search for the desired manual pages within the
index database caches. If the -u option is given, a cache
consistency check is performed to ensure the <br>
databases accurately reflect the filesystem. If this option
is always given, it is not generally necessary to run mandb
after the caches are initially created, <br>
unless a cache becomes corrupt. However, the cache
consistency check can be slow on systems with many manual
pages installed, so it is not performed by default, <br>
and system administrators may wish to run mandb every week
or so to keep the database caches fresh. To forestall
problems caused by outdated caches, man will fall <br>
back to file globbing if a cache lookup fails, just as it
would if no cache was present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a manual page has been
located, a check is performed to find out if a relative
preformatted &lsquo;cat&rsquo; file already exists and is
newer than the nroff file. If it <br>
does and is, this preformatted file is (usually)
decompressed and then displayed, via use of a pager. The
pager can be specified in a number of ways, or else will
<br>
fall back to a default is used (see option -P for details).
If no cat is found or is older than the nroff file, the
nroff is filtered through various programs and <br>
is shown immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a cat file can be produced (a
relative cat directory exists and has appropriate
permissions), man will compress and store the cat file in
the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filters are deciphered by a
number of means. Firstly, the command line option -p or the
environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated. If -p was
not used <br>
and the environment variable was not set, the initial line
of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string. To
contain a valid preprocessor string, the <br>
first line must resemble</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where string can be any
combination of letters described by option -p below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none of the above methods
provide any filter information, a default set is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A formatting pipeline is formed
from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or
[tg]roff with -t) and executed. Alternatively, if an
executable program <br>
mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree
root, it is executed instead. It gets passed the manual
source file, the preprocessor string, and op&acirc; <br>
tionally the device specified with -T or -E as
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Non argument options that are duplicated either on the
command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful. For
options that require an argument, each duplication <br>
will override the previous argument value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options <br>
-C file, --config-file=file <br>
Use this user configuration file rather than the default of
~/.manpath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Print debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --default <br>
This option is normally issued as the very first option and
resets man&rsquo;s behaviour to its default. Its use is to
reset those options that may have been set <br>
in $MANOPT. Any options that follow -D will have their usual
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warnings[=warnings] <br>
Enable warnings from groff. This may be used to perform
sanity checks on the source text of manual pages. warnings
is a comma-separated list of warning <br>
names; if it is not supplied, the default is
&quot;mac&quot;. See the &acirc;Warnings&acirc; node in info
groff for a list of available warning names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main modes of operation <br>
-f, --whatis <br>
Equivalent to whatis. Display a short description from the
manual page, if available. See whatis(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --apropos <br>
Equivalent to apropos. Search the short manual page
descriptions for keywords and display any matches. See
apropos(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --global-apropos <br>
Search for text in all manual pages. This is a brute-force
search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you
should specify a section to reduce the <br>
number of pages that need to be searched. Search terms may
be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if
the --regex option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this searches the
sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so
may include false positives due to things like comments in
source <br>
files. Searching the rendered text would be much slower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --local-file <br>
Activate &lsquo;local&rsquo; mode. Format and display local
manual files instead of searching through the system&rsquo;s
manual collection. Each manual page argument will <br>
be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct
format. No cat file is produced. If &rsquo;-&rsquo; is
listed as one of the arguments, input will be taken from
<br>
stdin. When this option is not used, and man fails to find
the page required, before displaying the error message, it
attempts to act as if this option was <br>
supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an
exact match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --where, --path, --location
<br>
Don&rsquo;t actually display the manual pages, but do print
the location(s) of the source nroff files that would be
formatted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --where-cat, --location-cat
<br>
Don&rsquo;t actually display the manual pages, but do print
the location(s) of the cat files that would be displayed. If
-w and -W are both specified, print both <br>
separated by a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --catman <br>
This option is not for general use and should only be used
by the catman program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R encoding, --recode=encoding
<br>
Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way,
output its source converted to the specified encoding. If
you already know the encoding of the <br>
source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly. However,
this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a
single encoding without having to <br>
explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they
were already installed in a structure similar to a manual
page hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finding manual pages <br>
-L locale, --locale=locale <br>
man will normally determine your current locale by a call to
the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various
environment variables, possibly includ&acirc; <br>
ing $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG. To temporarily override the
determined value, use this option to supply a locale string
directly to man. Note that it will not <br>
take effect until the search for pages actually begins.
Output such as the help message will always be displayed in
the initially determined locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m system[,...],
--systems=system[,...] <br>
If this system has access to other operating system&rsquo;s
manual pages, they can be accessed using this option. To
search for a manual page from NewOS&rsquo;s manual <br>
page collection, use the option -m NewOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The system specified can be a
combination of comma delimited operating system names. To
include a search of the native operating system&rsquo;s
manual pages, in&acirc; <br>
clude the system name man in the argument string. This
option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M path, --manpath=path <br>
Specify an alternate manpath to use. By default, man uses
manpath derived code to determine the path to search. This
option overrides the $MANPATH envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A path specified as a manpath
must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into
sections as described in the man-db manual (under &quot;The
manual page <br>
system&quot;). To view manual pages outside such
hierarchies, see the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S list, -s list,
--sections=list <br>
List is a colon- or comma-separated list of &lsquo;order
specific&rsquo; manual sections to search. This option
overrides the $MANSECT environment variable. (The -s <br>
spelling is for compatibility with System V.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e sub-extension,
--extension=sub-extension <br>
Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages,
such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main
manual page hierarchy. To get around <br>
the problem of having two manual pages with the same name
such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to
section l. As this is unfortunate, it <br>
is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and
to assign a specific &lsquo;extension&rsquo; to them, in
this case, exit(3tcl). Under normal operation, <br>
man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl). To
negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which
section the page you require resides <br>
in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string
indicating which package the page must belong to. Using the
above example, supplying the option <br>
-e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an
extension of *tcl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-case <br>
Ignore case when searching for manual pages. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --match-case <br>
Search for manual pages case-sensitively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--regex <br>
Show all pages with any part of either their names or their
descriptions matching each page argument as a regular
expression, as with apropos(1). Since <br>
there is usually no reasonable way to pick a
&quot;best&quot; page when searching for a regular
expression, this option implies -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wildcard <br>
Show all pages with any part of either their names or their
descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style
wildcards, as with apropos(1) --wild&acirc; <br>
card. The page argument must match the entire name or
description, or match on word boundaries in the description.
Since there is usually no reasonable <br>
way to pick a &quot;best&quot; page when searching for a
wildcard, this option implies -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--names-only <br>
If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page
names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1). Otherwise,
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --all <br>
By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable
manual page it finds. Using this option forces man to
display all the manual pages with names <br>
that match the search criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --update <br>
This option causes man to perform an &lsquo;inode
level&rsquo; consistency check on its database caches to
ensure that they are an accurate representation of the <br>
filesystem. It will only have a useful effect if man is
installed with the setuid bit set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-subpages <br>
By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page
names given on the command line as equivalent to a single
manual page name containing a hyphen or <br>
an underscore. This supports the common pattern of programs
that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to
provide manual pages for each that can <br>
be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke
the subcommands themselves. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ man -aw git diff <br>
/usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable this behaviour, use
the --no-subpages option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
<br>
/usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz <br>
/usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz <br>
/usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Controlling formatted output
<br>
-P pager, --pager=pager <br>
Specify which output pager to use. By default, man uses
pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not
executable. This option overrides the <br>
$MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the
$PAGER environment variable. It is not used in conjunction
with -f or -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value may be a simple
command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell
quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes). It
may not <br>
use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that,
use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display
either as an argument or on standard in&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r prompt, --prompt=prompt <br>
If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will
attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options. The
default prompt looks like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manual page name(sec) line x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where name denotes the manual
page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x
the current line number. This is achieved by using the $LESS
en&acirc; <br>
vironment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supplying -r with a string will
override this default. The string may contain the text
$MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the current
manual <br>
page and its section name surrounded by &lsquo;(&rsquo; and
&lsquo;)&rsquo;. The string used to produce the default
could be expressed as &nbsp;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manual&nbsp;page&nbsp;AN_PN&nbsp;?ltline&nbsp;%lt?L/%L.:
<br>
byte&nbsp;%bB?s/%s..?&nbsp;(END):?pB&nbsp;%pB\%.. <br>
(press h for help or q to quit)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is broken into three lines
here for the sake of readability only. For its meaning see
the less(1) manual page. The prompt string is first
evaluated by <br>
the shell. All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in
the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash. The
prompt string may end in an escaped <br>
$ which may be followed by further options for less. By
default man sets the -ix8 options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The $MANLESS environment
variable described below may be used to set a default prompt
string if none is supplied on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7, --ascii <br>
When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal
or terminal emulator, some characters may not display
correctly when using the latin1(7) device <br>
description with GNU nroff. This option allows pure ascii
manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1
device. It will not translate any latin1 <br>
text. The following table shows the translations performed:
some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using
GNU nroff&rsquo;s latin1(7) device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description Octal latin1 ascii

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the latin1 column displays
correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters
and this option is not necessary. If the latin1 and ascii
col&acirc; <br>
umns are identical, you are reading this page using this
option or man did not format this page using the latin1
device description. If the latin1 column <br>
is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages
with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is ignored when
using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff
other than GNU&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E encoding, --encoding=encoding
<br>
Generate output for a character encoding other than the
default. For backward compatibility, encoding may be an
nroff device such as ascii, latin1, or utf8 <br>
as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-hyphenation, --nh <br>
Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line
breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is
necessary to do so to lay out words on <br>
a line without excessive spacing. This option disables
automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if
they already contain hyphens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are writing a manual page
and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at
an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but consult
the <br>
nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put
&quot;&quot; inside a word to indicate that it may be
hyphenated at that point, or put &quot;&quot; at the start
of a <br>
word to prevent it from being hyphenated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-justification, --nj <br>
Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both
margins. This option disables full justification, leaving
justified only to the left margin, some&acirc; <br>
times called &quot;ragged-right&quot; text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are writing a manual page
and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain
paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult the nroff
documen&acirc; <br>
tation instead; for instance, you can use the
&quot;.na&quot;, &quot;.nf&quot;, &quot;.fi&quot;, and
&quot;.ad&quot; requests to temporarily disable adjusting
and filling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p string, --preprocessor=string
<br>
Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or
troff/groff. Not all installations will have a full set of
preprocessors. Some of the pre&acirc; <br>
processors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn
(e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r). This
option overrides the $MANROFFSEQ <br>
environment variable. zsoelim is always run as the very
first preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --troff <br>
Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout. This
option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or
-Z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T[device],
--troff-device[=device] <br>
This option is used to change groff (or possibly
troff&rsquo;s) output to be suitable for a device other than
the default. It implies -t. Examples (provided <br>
with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and
X100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H[browser], --html[=browser]
<br>
This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and
will display that output in a web browser. The choice of
browser is determined by the optional <br>
browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER
environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that
is unset (usually lynx). This option im&acirc; <br>
plies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi] <br>
This option displays the output of groff in a graphical
window using the gxditview program. The dpi (dots per inch)
may be 75, 75-12, 100, or 100-12, de&acirc; <br>
faulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.
This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or
X100-12 device respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --ditroff <br>
groff will run troff and then use an appropriate
post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen
device. If groff -mandoc is groff, this option is <br>
passed to groff and will suppress the use of a
post-processor. It implies -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting help <br>
-?, --help <br>
Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usage <br>

Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 At least one of the
pages/files/keywords didn&rsquo;t exist or wasn&rsquo;t
matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
MANPATH <br>
If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search
for manual pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANROFFOPT <br>
The contents of $MANROFFOPT are added to the command line
every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or
groff).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANROFFSEQ <br>
If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the
set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through. The
default preprocessor list is system <br>
dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANSECT <br>
If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of
sections and it is used to determine which manual sections
to search and in what order. The de&acirc; <br>
fault is &quot;1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6
7&quot;, unless overridden by the SECTION directive in
/etc/manpath.config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANPAGER, PAGER <br>
If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in
preference), its value is used as the name of the program
used to display the manual page. By default, <br>
pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or
is not executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value may be a simple
command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell
quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes). It
may not <br>
use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that,
use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display
either as an argument or on standard in&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANLESS <br>
If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default
prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed
using the -r option (so any occurrences <br>
of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way). For
example, if you want to set the prompt string
unconditionally to &acirc;my prompt string&acirc;, set
$MAN&acirc; <br>
LESS to &acirc;-Psmy prompt string&acirc;. Using the -r
option overrides this environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BROWSER <br>
If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of
commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a
web browser for man --html. In each <br>
command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML
output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign
(%), and %c is replaced by a colon (:).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it
will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the
argument to the -m option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it
will be parsed prior to man&rsquo;s command line and is
expected to be in a similar format. As all of the other man
specific environment <br>
variables can be expressed as command line options, and are
thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected
that they will become obsolete. <br>
N.B. All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an
option&rsquo;s argument must be escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MANWIDTH <br>
If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length
for which manual pages should be formatted. If it is not
set, manual pages will be formatted with <br>
a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the
value of $COLUMNS, an ioctl(2) if available, or falling back
to 80 characters if neither is <br>
available). Cat pages will only be saved when the default
formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
length is between 66 and 80 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING <br>
Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal
(such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are
discarded to make it easier to read the <br>
result without special tools. However, if
$MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these
formatting characters are retained. This may be useful <br>
for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAN_KEEP_STDERR <br>
Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal
(usually to a pager), any error output from the command used
to produce formatted versions of manual <br>
pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the
pager&rsquo;s display. Programs such as groff often produce
relatively minor error messages about typographical <br>
problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and
generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
page. However, some users want to see <br>
them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty
value, error output will be displayed as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG, LC_MESSAGES <br>
Depending on system and implementation, either or both of
$LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current
message locale. man will display its <br>
messages in that locale (if available). See setlocale(3) for
precise details.</p>
