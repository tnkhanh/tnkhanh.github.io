<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
java - Launches a Java application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
java [options] classname [args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java [options] -jar filename
[args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
Command-line options separated by spaces. See Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classname <br>
The name of the class to be launched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
The name of the Java Archive (JAR) file to be called. Used
only with the -jar option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">args <br>
The arguments passed to the main() method separated by
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The java command starts a Java application. It does this by
starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), loading the
specified class, and calling that class&rsquo;s <br>
main() method. The method must be declared public and
static, it must not return any value, and it must accept a
String array as a parameter. The method <br>
declaration has the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public static void main(String[]
args)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The java command can be used to
launch a JavaFX application by loading a class that either
has a main() method or that extends
javafx.application.Application. In <br>
the latter case, the launcher constructs an instance of the
Application class, calls its init() method, and then calls
the start(javafx.stage.Stage) method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the first argument
that is not an option of the java command is the fully
qualified name of the class to be called. If the -jar option
is specified, <br>
its argument is the name of the JAR file containing class
and resource files for the application. The startup class
must be indicated by the Main-Class manifest <br>
header in its source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JRE searches for the startup
class (and other classes used by the application) in three
sets of locations: the bootstrap class path, the installed
extensions, <br>
and the user&acirc;s class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments after the class file
name or the JAR file name are passed to the main()
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The java command supports a wide range of options that can
be divided into the following categories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Standard
Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Non-Standard
Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Advanced Runtime
Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Advanced JIT
Compiler Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Advanced
Serviceability Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Advanced Garbage
Collection Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard options are guaranteed
to be supported by all implementations of the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM). They are used for common actions, such as
checking the <br>
version of the JRE, setting the class path, enabling verbose
output, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-standard options are general
purpose options that are specific to the Java HotSpot
Virtual Machine, so they are not guaranteed to be supported
by all JVM <br>
implementations, and are subject to change. These options
start with -X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advanced options are not
recommended for casual use. These are developer options used
for tuning specific areas of the Java HotSpot Virtual
Machine operation that <br>
often have specific system requirements and may require
privileged access to system configuration parameters. They
are also not guaranteed to be supported by all <br>
JVM implementations, and are subject to change. Advanced
options start with -XX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To keep track of the options
that were deprecated or removed in the latest release, there
is a section named Deprecated and Removed Options at the end
of the <br>
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean options are used to
either enable a feature that is disabled by default or
disable a feature that is enabled by default. Such options
do not require a <br>
parameter. Boolean -XX options are enabled using the plus
sign (-XX:+OptionName) and disabled using the minus sign
(-XX:-OptionName).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For options that require an
argument, the argument may be separated from the option name
by a space, a colon (:), or an equal sign (=), or the
argument may <br>
directly follow the option (the exact syntax differs for
each option). If you are expected to specify the size in
bytes, you can use no suffix, or use the suffix k <br>
or K for kilobytes (KB), m or M for megabytes (MB), g or G
for gigabytes (GB). For example, to set the size to 8 GB,
you can specify either 8g, 8192m, 8388608k, or <br>
8589934592 as the argument. If you are expected to specify
the percentage, use a number from 0 to 1 (for example,
specify 0.25 for 25%).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard Options <br>
These are the most commonly used options that are supported
by all implementations of the JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:libname[=options] <br>
Loads the specified native agent library. After the library
name, a comma-separated list of options specific to the
library can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option -agentlib:foo is
specified, then the JVM attempts to load the library named
libfoo.so in the location specified by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
system <br>
variable (on OS X this variable is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to load the heap profiling tool (HPROF) library and get
sample CPU information every 20 ms, with a stack depth of
3:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,interval=20,depth=3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to load the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) library and
listen for the socket connection on port 8000, suspending
the JVM <br>
before the main class loads:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
native agent libraries, refer to the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; The
java.lang.instrument package description at

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Agent Command Line
Options in the JVM Tools Interface guide at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentpath:pathname[=options]
<br>
Loads the native agent library specified by the absolute
path name. This option is equivalent to -agentlib but uses
the full path and file name of the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-client <br>
Selects the Java HotSpot Client VM. The 64-bit version of
the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) currently ignores this
option and instead uses the Server JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For default JVM selection, see
Server-Class Machine Detection at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dproperty=value <br>
Sets a system property value. The property variable is a
string with no spaces that represents the name of the
property. The value variable is a string that <br>
represents the value of the property. If value is a string
with spaces, then enclose it in quotation marks (for example
-Dfoo=&quot;foo bar&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d32 <br>
Runs the application in a 32-bit environment. If a 32-bit
environment is not installed or is not supported, then an
error will be reported. By default, the <br>
application is run in a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit
system is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d64 <br>
Runs the application in a 64-bit environment. If a 64-bit
environment is not installed or is not supported, then an
error will be reported. By default, the <br>
application is run in a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit
system is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently only the Java HotSpot
Server VM supports 64-bit operation, and the -server option
is implicit with the use of -d64. The -client option is
ignored <br>
with the use of -d64. This is subject to change in a future
release.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disableassertions[:[packagename]...|:classname]
<br>
-da[:[packagename]...|:classname] <br>
Disables assertions. By default, assertions are disabled in
all packages and classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments,
-disableassertions (-da) disables assertions in all packages
and classes. With the packagename argument ending in ...,
the switch disables <br>
assertions in the specified package and any subpackages. If
the argument is simply ..., then the switch disables
assertions in the unnamed package in the <br>
current working directory. With the classname argument, the
switch disables assertions in the specified class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -disableassertions (-da)
option applies to all class loaders and to system classes
(which do not have a class loader). There is one exception
to this rule: <br>
if the option is provided with no arguments, then it does
not apply to system classes. This makes it easy to disable
assertions in all classes except for <br>
system classes. The -disablesystemassertions option enables
you to disable assertions in all system classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To explicitly enable assertions
in specific packages or classes, use the -enableassertions
(-ea) option. Both options can be used at the same time. For
<br>
example, to run the MyClass application with assertions
enabled in package com.wombat.fruitbat (and any subpackages)
but disabled in class <br>
com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, use the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat MyClass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disablesystemassertions <br>
-dsa <br>
Disables assertions in all system classes.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enableassertions[:[packagename]...|:classname]
<br>
-ea[:[packagename]...|:classname] <br>
Enables assertions. By default, assertions are disabled in
all packages and classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments,
-enableassertions (-ea) enables assertions in all packages
and classes. With the packagename argument ending in ...,
the switch enables <br>
assertions in the specified package and any subpackages. If
the argument is simply ..., then the switch enables
assertions in the unnamed package in the <br>
current working directory. With the classname argument, the
switch enables assertions in the specified class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -enableassertions (-ea)
option applies to all class loaders and to system classes
(which do not have a class loader). There is one exception
to this rule: <br>
if the option is provided with no arguments, then it does
not apply to system classes. This makes it easy to enable
assertions in all classes except for system <br>
classes. The -enablesystemassertions option provides a
separate switch to enable assertions in all system
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To explicitly disable assertions
in specific packages or classes, use the -disableassertions
(-da) option. If a single command contains multiple
instances of <br>
these switches, then they are processed in order before
loading any classes. For example, to run the MyClass
application with assertions enabled only in <br>
package com.wombat.fruitbat (and any subpackages) but
disabled in class com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, use the
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat MyClass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enablesystemassertions <br>
-esa <br>
Enables assertions in all system classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
-? <br>
Displays usage information for the java command without
actually running the JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jar filename <br>
Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The filename
argument is the name of a JAR file with a manifest that
contains a line in the form <br>
Main-Class:classname that defines the class with the public
static void main(String[] args) method that serves as your
application&rsquo;s starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you use the -jar option,
the specified JAR file is the source of all user classes,
and other class path settings are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about JAR
files, see the following resources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/index.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-javaagent:jarpath[=options]
<br>
Loads the specified Java programming language agent. For
more information about instrumenting Java applications, see
the java.lang.instrument package <br>
description in the Java API documentation at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jre-restrict-search <br>
Includes user-private JREs in the version search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-jre-restrict-search <br>
Excludes user-private JREs from the version search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-server <br>
Selects the Java HotSpot Server VM. The 64-bit version of
the JDK supports only the Server VM, so in that case the
option is implicit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For default JVM selection, see
Server-Class Machine Detection at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showversion <br>
Displays version information and continues execution of the
application. This option is equivalent to the -version
option except that the latter instructs the <br>
JVM to exit after displaying version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-splash:imgname <br>
Shows the splash screen with the image specified by imgname.
For example, to show the splash.gif file from the images
directory when starting your application, <br>
use the following option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-splash:images/splash.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:class <br>
Displays information about each loaded class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:gc <br>
Displays information about each garbage collection (GC)
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:jni <br>
Displays information about the use of native methods and
other Java Native Interface (JNI) activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Displays version information and then exits. This option is
equivalent to the -showversion option except that the latter
does not instruct the JVM to exit <br>
after displaying version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version:release <br>
Specifies the release version to be used for running the
application. If the version of the java command called does
not meet this specification and an <br>
appropriate implementation is found on the system, then the
appropriate implementation will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The release argument specifies
either the exact version string, or a list of version
strings and ranges separated by spaces. A version string is
the developer <br>
designation of the version number in the following form:
1.x.0_u (where x is the major version number, and u is the
update version number). A version range is <br>
made up of a version string followed by a plus sign (+) to
designate this version or later, or a part of a version
string followed by an asterisk (*) to <br>
designate any version string with a matching prefix. Version
strings and ranges can be combined using a space for a
logical OR combination, or an ampersand (&amp;) <br>
for a logical AND combination of two version strings/ranges.
For example, if running the class or JAR file requires
either JRE 6u13 (1.6.0_13), or any JRE 6 <br>
starting from 6u10 (1.6.0_10), specify the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version:&quot;1.6.0_13 1.6*
&amp; 1.6.0_10+&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quotation marks are necessary
only if there are spaces in the release parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For JAR files, the preference is
to specify version requirements in the JAR file manifest
rather than on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-Standard Options <br>
These options are general purpose options that are specific
to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X <br>
Displays help for all available -X options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbatch <br>
Disables background compilation. By default, the JVM
compiles the method as a background task, running the method
in interpreter mode until the background <br>
compilation is finished. The -Xbatch flag disables
background compilation so that compilation of all methods
proceeds as a foreground task until completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
-XX:-BackgroundCompilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath:path <br>
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives
separated by colons (:) to search for boot class files.
These are used in place of the boot class <br>
files included in the JDK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not deploy applications that
use this option to override a class in rt.jar, because this
violates the JRE binary code license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath/a:path <br>
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives
separated by colons (:) to append to the end of the default
bootstrap class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not deploy applications that
use this option to override a class in rt.jar, because this
violates the JRE binary code license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath/p:path <br>
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives
separated by colons (:) to prepend to the front of the
default bootstrap class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not deploy applications that
use this option to override a class in rt.jar, because this
violates the JRE binary code license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xcheck:jni <br>
Performs additional checks for Java Native Interface (JNI)
functions. Specifically, it validates the parameters passed
to the JNI function and the runtime <br>
environment data before processing the JNI request. Any
invalid data encountered indicates a problem in the native
code, and the JVM will terminate with an <br>
irrecoverable error in such cases. Expect a performance
degradation when this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xcomp <br>
Forces compilation of methods on first invocation. By
default, the Client VM (-client) performs 1,000 interpreted
method invocations and the Server VM <br>
(-server) performs 10,000 interpreted method invocations to
gather information for efficient compilation. Specifying the
-Xcomp option disables interpreted <br>
method invocations to increase compilation performance at
the expense of efficiency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also change the number
of interpreted method invocations before compilation using
the -XX:CompileThreshold option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xdebug <br>
Does nothing. Provided for backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xdiag <br>
Shows additional diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xfuture <br>
Enables strict class-file format checks that enforce close
conformance to the class-file format specification.
Developers are encouraged to use this flag when <br>
developing new code because the stricter checks will become
the default in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xint <br>
Runs the application in interpreted-only mode. Compilation
to native code is disabled, and all bytecode is executed by
the interpreter. The performance <br>
benefits offered by the just in time (JIT) compiler are not
present in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xinternalversion <br>
Displays more detailed JVM version information than the
-version option, and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xloggc:filename <br>
Sets the file to which verbose GC events information should
be redirected for logging. The information written to this
file is similar to the output of <br>
-verbose:gc with the time elapsed since the first GC event
preceding each logged event. The -Xloggc option overrides
-verbose:gc if both are given with the <br>
same java command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xloggc:garbage-collection.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmaxjitcodesize=size <br>
Specifies the maximum code cache size (in bytes) for
JIT-compiled code. Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to <br>
indicate gigabytes. The default maximum code cache size is
240 MB; if you disable tiered compilation with the option
-XX:-TieredCompilation, then the default <br>
size is 48 MB:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmaxjitcodesize=240m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmixed <br>
Executes all bytecode by the interpreter except for hot
methods, which are compiled to native code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmnsize <br>
Sets the initial and maximum size (in bytes) of the heap for
the young generation (nursery). Append the letter k or K to
indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate <br>
megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The young generation region of
the heap is used for new objects. GC is performed in this
region more often than in other regions. If the size for the
young <br>
generation is too small, then a lot of minor garbage
collections will be performed. If the size is too large,
then only full garbage collections will be <br>
performed, which can take a long time to complete. Oracle
recommends that you keep the size for the young generation
between a half and a quarter of the <br>
overall heap size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples show how
to set the initial and maximum size of young generation to
256 MB using various units:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmn256m <br>
-Xmn262144k <br>
-Xmn268435456</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of the -Xmn option to
set both the initial and maximum size of the heap for the
young generation, you can use -XX:NewSize to set the initial
size and <br>
-XX:MaxNewSize to set the maximum size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmssize <br>
Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the heap. This value
must be a multiple of 1024 and greater than 1 MB. Append the
letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or <br>
M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples show how
to set the size of allocated memory to 6 MB using various
units:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xms6291456 <br>
-Xms6144k <br>
-Xms6m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not set this option,
then the initial size will be set as the sum of the sizes
allocated for the old generation and the young generation.
The initial <br>
size of the heap for the young generation can be set using
the -Xmn option or the -XX:NewSize option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmxsize <br>
Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of the memory
allocation pool in bytes. This value must be a multiple of
1024 and greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k <br>
or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g
or G to indicate gigabytes. The default value is chosen at
runtime based on system configuration. <br>
For server deployments, -Xms and -Xmx are often set to the
same value. See the section &quot;Ergonomics&quot; in Java
SE HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection <br>
Tuning Guide at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples show how
to set the maximum allowed size of allocated memory to 80 MB
using various units:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmx83886080 <br>
-Xmx81920k <br>
-Xmx80m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Xmx option is equivalent to
-XX:MaxHeapSize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xnoclassgc <br>
Disables garbage collection (GC) of classes. This can save
some GC time, which shortens interruptions during the
application run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify -Xnoclassgc at
startup, the class objects in the application will be left
untouched during GC and will always be considered live. This
can <br>
result in more memory being permanently occupied which, if
not used carefully, will throw an out of memory
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xrs <br>
Reduces the use of operating system signals by the JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shutdown hooks enable orderly
shutdown of a Java application by running user cleanup code
(such as closing database connections) at shutdown, even if
the JVM <br>
terminates abruptly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JVM catches signals to
implement shutdown hooks for unexpected termination. The JVM
uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM to initiate the running of
shutdown <br>
hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JVM uses a similar mechanism
to implement the feature of dumping thread stacks for
debugging purposes. The JVM uses SIGQUIT to perform thread
dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applications embedding the JVM
frequently need to trap signals such as SIGINT or SIGTERM,
which can lead to interference with the JVM signal handlers.
The -Xrs <br>
option is available to address this issue. When -Xrs is
used, the signal masks for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and
SIGQUIT are not changed by the JVM, and signal <br>
handlers for these signals are not installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two consequences of
specifying -Xrs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; SIGQUIT thread
dumps are not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; User code is
responsible for causing shutdown hooks to run, for example,
by calling System.exit() when the JVM is to be
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xshare:mode <br>
Sets the class data sharing (CDS) mode. Possible mode
arguments for this option include the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto <br>
Use CDS if possible. This is the default value for Java
HotSpot 32-Bit Client VM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on <br>
Require the use of CDS. Print an error message and exit if
class data sharing cannot be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off <br>
Do not use CDS. This is the default value for Java HotSpot
32-Bit Server VM, Java HotSpot 64-Bit Client VM, and Java
HotSpot 64-Bit Server VM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump <br>
Manually generate the CDS archive. Specify the application
class path as described in &quot;Setting the Class Path
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should regenerate the CDS
archive with each new JDK release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XshowSettings:category <br>
Shows settings and continues. Possible category arguments
for this option include the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all <br>
Shows all categories of settings. This is the default
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">locale <br>
Shows settings related to locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">properties <br>
Shows settings related to system properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vm <br>
Shows the settings of the JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xsssize <br>
Sets the thread stack size (in bytes). Append the letter k
or K to indicate KB, m or M to indicate MB, g or G to
indicate GB. The default value depends on the <br>
platform:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Linux/ARM

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xss1m <br>
-Xss1024k <br>
-Xss1048576</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
-XX:ThreadStackSize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xusealtsigs <br>
Use alternative signals instead of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 for
JVM internal signals. This option is equivalent to
-XX:+UseAltSigs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xverify:mode <br>
Sets the mode of the bytecode verifier. Bytecode
verification helps to troubleshoot some problems, but it
also adds overhead to the running application. <br>
Possible mode arguments for this option include the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
Do not verify the bytecode. This reduces startup time and
also reduces the protection provided by Java.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote <br>
Verify those classes that are not loaded by the bootstrap
class loader. This is the default behavior if you do not
specify the -Xverify option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all <br>
Verify all classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advanced Runtime Options <br>
These options control the runtime behavior of the Java
HotSpot VM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism <br>
Enables the option that disables the mechanism that lets
tools attach to the JVM. By default, this option is
disabled, meaning that the attach mechanism is <br>
enabled and you can use tools such as jcmd, jstack, jmap,
and jinfo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ErrorFile=filename <br>
Specifies the path and file name to which error data is
written when an irrecoverable error occurs. By default, this
file is created in the current working <br>
directory and named hs_err_pidpid.log where pid is the
identifier of the process that caused the error. The
following example shows how to set the default log <br>
file (note that the identifier of the process is specified
as %p):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ErrorFile=./hs_err_pid%p.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the error log to /var/log/java/java_error.log:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ErrorFile=/var/log/java/java_error.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file cannot be created in
the specified directory (due to insufficient space,
permission problem, or another issue), then the file is
created in the <br>
temporary directory for the operating system. The temporary
directory is /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+FailOverToOldVerifier <br>
Enables automatic failover to the old verifier when the new
type checker fails. By default, this option is disabled and
it is ignored (that is, treated as <br>
disabled) for classes with a recent bytecode version. You
can enable it for classes with older versions of the
bytecode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:LargePageSizeInBytes=size
<br>
On Solaris, sets the maximum size (in bytes) for large pages
used for Java heap. The size argument must be a power of 2
(2, 4, 8, 16, ...). Append the letter k <br>
or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g
or G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the size is set to
0, meaning that the JVM chooses the size <br>
for large pages automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example
illustrates how to set the large page size to 4 megabytes
(MB):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:LargePageSizeInBytes=4m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=size
<br>
Sets the maximum total size (in bytes) of the New I/O (the
java.nio package) direct-buffer allocations. Append the
letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M <br>
to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By
default, the size is set to 0, meaning that the JVM chooses
the size for NIO direct-buffer allocations <br>
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples
illustrate how to set the NIO size to 1024 KB in different
units:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1m <br>
-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1024k <br>
-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1048576</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=mode
<br>
Specifies the mode for tracking JVM native memory usage.
Possible mode arguments for this option include the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off <br>
Do not track JVM native memory usage. This is the default
behavior if you do not specify the -XX:NativeMemoryTracking
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summary <br>
Only track memory usage by JVM subsystems, such as Java
heap, class, code, and thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detail <br>
In addition to tracking memory usage by JVM subsystems,
track memory usage by individual CallSite, individual
virtual memory region and its committed <br>
regions.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes=alignment
<br>
Sets the memory alignment of Java objects (in bytes). By
default, the value is set to 8 bytes. The specified value
should be a power of two, and must be within <br>
the range of 8 and 256 (inclusive). This option makes it
possible to use compressed pointers with large Java heap
sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The heap size limit in bytes is
calculated as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4GB * ObjectAlignmentInBytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: As the alignment value
increases, the unused space between objects will also
increase. As a result, you may not realize any benefits from
using <br>
compressed pointers with large Java heap sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:OnError=string <br>
Sets a custom command or a series of semicolon-separated
commands to run when an irrecoverable error occurs. If the
string contains spaces, then it must be <br>
enclosed in quotation marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
the -XX:OnError option can be used to run the gcore command
to create the core image, and the debugger is started to
attach to <br>
the process in case of an irrecoverable error (the %p
designates the current process):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:OnError=&quot;gcore %p;dbx -
%p&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=string
<br>
Sets a custom command or a series of semicolon-separated
commands to run when an OutOfMemoryError exception is first
thrown. If the string contains spaces, <br>
then it must be enclosed in quotation marks. For an example
of a command string, see the description of the -XX:OnError
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PerfDataSaveToFile <br>
If enabled, saves jstat(1) binary data when the Java
application exits. This binary data is saved in a file named
hsperfdata_&lt;pid&gt;, where &lt;pid&gt; is the process
<br>
identifier of the Java application you ran. Use jstat to
display the performance data contained in this file as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jstat -class
file:///&lt;path&gt;/hsperfdata_&lt;pid&gt; <br>
jstat -gc file:///&lt;path&gt;/hsperfdata_&lt;pid&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags <br>
Enables printing of ergonomically selected JVM flags that
appeared on the command line. It can be useful to know the
ergonomic values set by the JVM, such as <br>
the heap space size and the selected garbage collector. By
default, this option is disabled and flags are not
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintNMTStatistics <br>
Enables printing of collected native memory tracking data at
JVM exit when native memory tracking is enabled (see
-XX:NativeMemoryTracking). By default, this <br>
option is disabled and native memory tracking data is not
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+RelaxAccessControlCheck
<br>
Decreases the amount of access control checks in the
verifier. By default, this option is disabled, and it is
ignored (that is, treated as disabled) for <br>
classes with a recent bytecode version. You can enable it
for classes with older versions of the bytecode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+ShowMessageBoxOnError <br>
Enables displaying of a dialog box when the JVM experiences
an irrecoverable error. This prevents the JVM from exiting
and keeps the process active so that you <br>
can attach a debugger to it to investigate the cause of the
error. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ThreadStackSize=size <br>
Sets the thread stack size (in bytes). Append the letter k
or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g
or G to indicate gigabytes. The default <br>
value depends on the platform:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; Linux/ARM

-XX:ThreadStackSize=1024k <br>
-XX:ThreadStackSize=1048576</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is equivalent to
-Xss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+TraceClassLoading <br>
Enables tracing of classes as they are loaded. By default,
this option is disabled and classes are not traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+TraceClassLoadingPreorder
<br>
Enables tracing of all loaded classes in the order in which
they are referenced. By default, this option is disabled and
classes are not traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+TraceClassResolution <br>
Enables tracing of constant pool resolutions. By default,
this option is disabled and constant pool resolutions are
not traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+TraceClassUnloading <br>
Enables tracing of classes as they are unloaded. By default,
this option is disabled and classes are not traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+TraceLoaderConstraints <br>
Enables tracing of the loader constraints recording. By
default, this option is disabled and loader constraints
recording is not traced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseAltSigs <br>
Enables the use of alternative signals instead of SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 for JVM internal signals. By default, this
option is disabled and alternative signals are <br>
not used. This option is equivalent to -Xusealtsigs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:-UseBiasedLocking <br>
Disables the use of biased locking. Some applications with
significant amounts of uncontended synchronization may
attain significant speedups with this flag <br>
enabled, whereas applications with certain patterns of
locking may see slowdowns. For more information about the
biased locking technique, see the example in <br>
Java Tuning White Paper at
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/tuning-139912.html#section4.2.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, this option is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:-UseCompressedOops <br>
Disables the use of compressed pointers. By default, this
option is enabled, and compressed pointers are used when
Java heap sizes are less than 32 GB. When <br>
this option is enabled, object references are represented as
32-bit offsets instead of 64-bit pointers, which typically
increases performance when running the <br>
application with Java heap sizes less than 32 GB. This
option works only for 64-bit JVMs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to use
compressed pointers when Java heap sizes are greater than
32GB. See the -XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseHugeTLBFS <br>
This option for Linux is the equivalent of specifying
-XX:+UseLargePages. This option is disabled by default. This
option pre-allocates all large pages <br>
up-front, when memory is reserved; consequently the JVM
cannot dynamically grow or shrink large pages memory areas;
see -XX:UseTransparentHugePages if you want <br>
this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see
&quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseLargePages <br>
Enables the use of large page memory. By default, this
option is disabled and large page memory is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see
&quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseMembar <br>
Enables issuing of membars on thread state transitions. This
option is disabled by default on all platforms except ARM
servers, where it is enabled. (It is <br>
recommended that you do not disable this option on ARM
servers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UsePerfData <br>
Enables the perfdata feature. This option is enabled by
default to allow JVM monitoring and performance testing.
Disabling it suppresses the creation of the <br>
hsperfdata_userid directories. To disable the perfdata
feature, specify -XX:-UsePerfData.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages
<br>
On Linux, enables the use of large pages that can
dynamically grow or shrink. This option is disabled by
default. You may encounter performance problems with <br>
transparent huge pages as the OS moves other pages around to
create huge pages; this option is made available for
experimentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see
&quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+AllowUserSignalHandlers
<br>
Enables installation of signal handlers by the application.
By default, this option is disabled and the application is
not allowed to install signal handlers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advanced JIT Compiler Options
<br>
These options control the dynamic just-in-time (JIT)
compilation performed by the Java HotSpot VM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+AggressiveOpts <br>
Enables the use of aggressive performance optimization
features, which are expected to become default in upcoming
releases. By default, this option is disabled <br>
and experimental performance features are not used.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocateInstancePrefetchLines=lines
<br>
Sets the number of lines to prefetch ahead of the instance
allocation pointer. By default, the number of lines to
prefetch is set to 1:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocateInstancePrefetchLines=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the Java HotSpot Server VM
supports this option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchDistance=size
<br>
Sets the size (in bytes) of the prefetch distance for object
allocation. Memory about to be written with the value of new
objects is prefetched up to this <br>
distance starting from the address of the last allocated
object. Each Java thread has its own allocation point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negative values denote that
prefetch distance is chosen based on the platform. Positive
values are bytes to prefetch. Append the letter k or K to
indicate <br>
kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate
gigabytes. The default value is set to -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the prefetch distance to 1024 bytes:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchDistance=1024</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the Java HotSpot Server VM
supports this option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchInstr=instruction
<br>
Sets the prefetch instruction to prefetch ahead of the
allocation pointer. Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports
this option. Possible values are from 0 to <br>
3. The actual instructions behind the values depend on the
platform. By default, the prefetch instruction is set to
0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchInstr=0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the Java HotSpot Server VM
supports this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchLines=lines
<br>
Sets the number of cache lines to load after the last object
allocation by using the prefetch instructions generated in
compiled code. The default value is 1 <br>
if the last allocated object was an instance, and 3 if it
was an array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the number of loaded cache lines to 5:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchLines=5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the Java HotSpot Server VM
supports this option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchStepSize=size
<br>
Sets the step size (in bytes) for sequential prefetch
instructions. Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to <br>
indicate gigabytes. By default, the step size is set to 16
bytes:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:AllocatePrefetchStepSize=16</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the Java HotSpot Server VM

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 <br>
Execute prefetch instructions after each allocation. This is
the default parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 <br>
Use the thread-local allocation block (TLAB) watermark
pointer to determine when prefetch instructions are
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 <br>
Use BIS instruction on SPARC for allocation prefetch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the Java HotSpot Server VM
supports this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+BackgroundCompilation <br>
Enables background compilation. This option is enabled by
default. To disable background compilation, specify
-XX:-BackgroundCompilation (this is equivalent to <br>
specifying -Xbatch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CICompilerCount=threads <br>
Sets the number of compiler threads to use for compilation.
By default, the number of threads is set to 2 for the server
JVM, to 1 for the client JVM, and it <br>
scales to the number of cores if tiered compilation is used.
The following example shows how to set the number of threads
to 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CICompilerCount=2</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CodeCacheMinimumFreeSpace=size
<br>
Sets the minimum free space (in bytes) required for
compilation. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes,
m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to <br>
indicate gigabytes. When less than the minimum free space
remains, compiling stops. By default, this option is set to
500 KB. The following example shows how <br>
to set the minimum free space to 1024 MB:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CodeCacheMinimumFreeSpace=1024m</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommand=command,method[,option]
<br>
Specifies a command to perform on a method. For example, to
exclude the indexOf() method of the String class from being
compiled, use the following:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java/lang/String.indexOf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the full class name is
specified, including all packages and subpackages separated
by a slash (/). For easier cut and paste operations, it is
also <br>
possible to use the method name format produced by the
-XX:+PrintCompilation and -XX:+LogCompilation options:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java.lang.String::indexOf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the method is specified
without the signature, the command will be applied to all
methods with the specified name. However, you can also
specify the <br>
signature of the method in the class file format. In this
case, you should enclose the arguments in quotation marks,
because otherwise the shell treats the <br>
semicolon as command end. For example, if you want to
exclude only the indexOf(String) method of the String class
from being compiled, use the following:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommand=&quot;exclude,java/lang/String.indexOf,(Ljava/lang/String;)I&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use the asterisk
(*) as a wildcard for class and method names. For example,
to exclude all indexOf() methods in all classes from being
compiled, <br>
use the following:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,*.indexOf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commas and periods are
aliases for spaces, making it easier to pass compiler
commands through a shell. You can pass arguments to
-XX:CompileCommand using <br>
spaces as separators by enclosing the argument in quotation
marks:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommand=&quot;exclude
java/lang/String indexOf&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that after parsing the
commands passed on the command line using the
-XX:CompileCommand options, the JIT compiler then reads
commands from the <br>
.hotspot_compiler file. You can add commands to this file or
specify a different file using the -XX:CompileCommandFile
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add several commands, either
specify the -XX:CompileCommand option multiple times, or
separate each argument with the newline separator (0. The
following <br>
commands are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break <br>
Set a breakpoint when debugging the JVM to stop at the
beginning of compilation of the specified method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compileonly <br>
Exclude all methods from compilation except for the
specified method. As an alternative, you can use the
-XX:CompileOnly option, which allows to specify <br>
several methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dontinline <br>
Prevent inlining of the specified method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exclude <br>
Exclude the specified method from compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Print a help message for the -XX:CompileCommand option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inline <br>
Attempt to inline the specified method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log <br>
Exclude compilation logging (with the -XX:+LogCompilation
option) for all methods except for the specified method. By
default, logging is performed for all <br>
compiled methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option <br>
This command can be used to pass a JIT compilation option to
the specified method in place of the last argument (option).
The compilation option is set at <br>
the end, after the method name. For example, to enable the
BlockLayoutByFrequency option for the append() method of the
StringBuffer class, use the <br>
following:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommand=option,java/lang/StringBuffer.append,BlockLayoutByFrequency</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify multiple
compilation options, separated by commas or spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print <br>
Print generated assembler code after compilation of the
specified method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet <br>
Do not print the compile commands. By default, the commands
that you specify with the -XX:CompileCommand option are
printed; for example, if you exclude <br>
from compilation the indexOf() method of the String class,
then the following will be printed to standard output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CompilerOracle: exclude
java/lang/String.indexOf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can suppress this by
specifying the -XX:CompileCommand=quiet option before other
-XX:CompileCommand options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CompileCommandFile=filename
<br>
Sets the file from which JIT compiler commands are read. By

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:RTMAbortRatio=abort_ratio
<br>
The RTM abort ratio is specified as a percentage (%) of all
executed RTM transactions. If a number of aborted
transactions becomes greater than this ratio, <br>
then the compiled code will be deoptimized. This ratio is
used when the -XX:+UseRTMDeopt option is enabled. The
default value of this option is 50. This means <br>
that the compiled code will be deoptimized if 50% of all
transactions are aborted.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:RTMRetryCount=number_of_retries
<br>
RTM locking code will be retried, when it is aborted or

flushing of the code cache before shutting <br>
down the compiler, specify -XX:-UseCodeCacheFlushing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseCondCardMark <br>
Enables checking of whether the card is already marked
before updating the card table. This option is disabled by
default and should only be used on machines <br>
with multiple sockets, where it will increase performance of
Java applications that rely heavily on concurrent
operations. Only the Java HotSpot Server VM <br>
supports this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseRTMDeopt <br>
Auto-tunes RTM locking depending on the abort ratio. This
ratio is specified by -XX:RTMAbortRatio option. If the
number of aborted transactions exceeds the <br>
abort ratio, then the method containing the lock will be
deoptimized and recompiled with all locks as normal locks.
This option is disabled by default. The <br>
-XX:+UseRTMLocking option must be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseRTMLocking <br>
Generate Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM) locking code
for all inflated locks, with the normal locking mechanism as
the fallback handler. This option is <br>
disabled by default. Options related to RTM are only
available for the Java HotSpot Server VM on x86 CPUs that
support Transactional Synchronization Extensions <br>
(TSX).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RTM is part of Intel&rsquo;s
TSX, which is an x86 instruction set extension and
facilitates the creation of multithreaded applications. RTM
introduces the new <br>
instructions XBEGIN, XABORT, XEND, and XTEST. The XBEGIN and
XEND instructions enclose a set of instructions to run as a
transaction. If no conflict is found <br>
when running the transaction, the memory and register
modifications are committed together at the XEND
instruction. The XABORT instruction can be used to <br>
explicitly abort a transaction and the XEND instruction to
check if a set of instructions are being run in a
transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A lock on a transaction is
inflated when another thread tries to access the same
transaction, thereby blocking the thread that did not
originally request <br>
access to the transaction. RTM requires that a fallback set
of operations be specified in case a transaction aborts or
fails. An RTM lock is a lock that has <br>
been delegated to the TSX&rsquo;s system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RTM improves performance for
highly contended locks with low conflict in a critical
region (which is code that must not be accessed by more than
one thread <br>
concurrently). RTM also improves the performance of
coarse-grain locking, which typically does not perform well
in multithreaded applications. (Coarse-grain <br>
locking is the strategy of holding locks for long periods to
minimize the overhead of taking and releasing locks, while
fine-grained locking is the strategy of <br>
trying to achieve maximum parallelism by locking only when
necessary and unlocking as soon as possible.) Also, for
lightly contended locks that are used by <br>
different threads, RTM can reduce false cache line sharing,
also known as cache line ping-pong. This occurs when
multiple threads from different processors are <br>
accessing different resources, but the resources share the
same cache line. As a result, the processors repeatedly
invalidate the cache lines of other <br>
processors, which forces them to read from main memory
instead of their cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseSHA <br>
Enables hardware-based intrinsics for SHA crypto hash
functions for SPARC hardware. UseSHA is used in conjunction
with the UseSHA1Intrinsics, <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The UseSHA and UseSHA*Intrinsics
flags are enabled by default, and are supported only for
Java HotSpot Server VM 64-bit on SPARC T4 and newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxHeapSize=size <br>
Sets the maximum size (in byes) of the memory allocation
pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024 and greater than
2 MB. Append the letter k or K to <br>
indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to
indicate gigabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime
based on system configuration. For <br>
server deployments, -XX:InitialHeapSize and -XX:MaxHeapSize
are often set to the same value. See the section
&quot;Ergonomics&quot; in Java SE HotSpot Virtual Machine
<br>
Garbage Collection Tuning Guide at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples show how
to set the maximum allowed size of allocated memory to 80 MB
using various units:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxHeapSize=83886080 <br>
-XX:MaxHeapSize=81920k <br>
-XX:MaxHeapSize=80m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Oracle Solaris 7 and Oracle
Solaris 8 SPARC platforms, the upper limit for this value is
approximately 4,000 MB minus overhead amounts. On Oracle

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -XX:MaxHeapSize option is
equivalent to -Xmx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=percent
<br>
Sets the maximum allowed percentage of free heap space (0 to
100) after a GC event. If free heap space expands above this
value, then the heap will be shrunk. <br>
By default, this value is set to 70%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the maximum free heap ratio to 75%:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=75</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=size <br>
Sets the maximum amount of native memory that can be
allocated for class metadata. By default, the size is not
limited. The amount of metadata for an <br>
application depends on the application itself, other running
applications, and the amount of memory available on the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the maximum class metadata size to 256 MB:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxNewSize=size <br>
Sets the maximum size (in bytes) of the heap for the young
generation (nursery). The default value is set
ergonomically.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=threshold
<br>
Sets the maximum tenuring threshold for use in adaptive GC
sizing. The largest value is 15. The default value is 15 for
the parallel (throughput) collector, <br>
and 6 for the CMS collector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the maximum tenuring threshold to 10:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MetaspaceSize=size <br>
Sets the size of the allocated class metadata space that
will trigger a garbage collection the first time it is
exceeded. This threshold for a garbage <br>
collection is increased or decreased depending on the amount
of metadata used. The default size depends on the
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=percent
<br>
Sets the minimum allowed percentage of free heap space (0 to
100) after a GC event. If free heap space falls below this
value, then the heap will be expanded. <br>
By default, this value is set to 40%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the minimum free heap ratio to 25%:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:NewRatio=ratio <br>
Sets the ratio between young and old generation sizes. By
default, this option is set to 2. The following example
shows how to set the young/old ratio to 1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:NewRatio=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:NewSize=size <br>
Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the heap for the young
generation (nursery). Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, <br>
g or G to indicate gigabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The young generation region of
the heap is used for new objects. GC is performed in this
region more often than in other regions. If the size for the
young <br>
generation is too low, then a large number of minor GCs will
be performed. If the size is too high, then only full GCs
will be performed, which can take a long <br>
time to complete. Oracle recommends that you keep the size
for the young generation between a half and a quarter of the
overall heap size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples show how
to set the initial size of young generation to 256 MB using
various units:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -XX:NewSize option is
equivalent to -Xmn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ParallelGCThreads=threads
<br>
Sets the number of threads used for parallel garbage
collection in the young and old generations. The default
value depends on the number of CPUs available to <br>
the JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to set the number
of threads for parallel GC to 2, specify the following
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:ParallelGCThreads=2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled <br>
Enables parallel reference processing. By default, this
option is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy
<br>
Enables printing of information about adaptive generation
sizing. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintGC <br>
Enables printing of messages at every GC. By default, this
option is disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime
<br>
Enables printing of how much time elapsed since the last
pause (for example, a GC pause). By default, this option is
disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
<br>
Enables printing of how much time the pause (for example, a
GC pause) lasted. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps <br>
Enables printing of a date stamp at every GC. By default,
this option is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintGCDetails <br>
Enables printing of detailed messages at every GC. By
default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintGCTaskTimeStamps <br>
Enables printing of time stamps for every individual GC
worker thread task. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

Enables printing of time stamps at every GC. By default,
this option is disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics
<br>
Prints detailed deduplication statistics. By default, this
option is disabled. See the -XX:+UseStringDeduplication
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
<br>
Enables printing of tenuring age information. The following
is an example of the output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Desired survivor size 48286924
bytes, new threshold 10 (max 10) <br>
- age 1: 28992024 bytes, 28992024 total <br>

- age 3: 1425912 bytes, 31784800 total <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Age 1 objects are the youngest
survivors (they were created after the previous scavenge,
survived the latest scavenge, and moved from eden to
survivor space). <br>
Age 2 objects have survived two scavenges (during the second
scavenge they were copied from one survivor space to the
next). And so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the preceding example, 28 992
024 bytes survived one scavenge and were copied from eden to
survivor space, 1 366 864 bytes are occupied by age 2
objects, <br>
etc. The third value in each row is the cumulative size of
objects of age n or less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, this option is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+ScavengeBeforeFullGC <br>
Enables GC of the young generation before each full GC. This
option is enabled by default. Oracle recommends that you do
not disable it, because scavenging the <br>
young generation before a full GC can reduce the number of
objects reachable from the old generation space into the
young generation space. To disable GC of <br>
the young generation before each full GC, specify
-XX:-ScavengeBeforeFullGC.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=time
<br>
Sets the amount of time (in milliseconds) a softly reachable
object is kept active on the heap after the last time it was
referenced. The default value is one <br>
second of lifetime per free megabyte in the heap. The
-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB option accepts integer values
representing milliseconds per one megabyte of <br>
the current heap size (for Java HotSpot Client VM) or the
maximum possible heap size (for Java HotSpot Server VM).
This difference means that the Client VM <br>
tends to flush soft references rather than grow the heap,
whereas the Server VM tends to grow the heap rather than
flush soft references. In the latter case, <br>
the value of the -Xmx option has a significant effect on how
quickly soft references are garbage collected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the value to 2.5 seconds:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=2500</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:StringDeduplicationAgeThreshold=threshold
<br>
String objects reaching the specified age are considered
candidates for deduplication. An object&rsquo;s age is a
measure of how many times it has survived garbage <br>
collection. This is sometimes referred to as tenuring; see
the -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution option. Note that String
objects that are promoted to an old heap <br>
region before this age has been reached are always
considered candidates for deduplication. The default value
for this option is 3. See the <br>
-XX:+UseStringDeduplication option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:SurvivorRatio=ratio <br>
Sets the ratio between eden space size and survivor space
size. By default, this option is set to 8. The following
example shows how to set the eden/survivor <br>
space ratio to 4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:SurvivorRatio=4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=percent
<br>
Sets the desired percentage of survivor space (0 to 100)
used after young garbage collection. By default, this option
is set to 50%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the target survivor space ratio to 30%:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:TLABSize=size <br>
Sets the initial size (in bytes) of a thread-local
allocation buffer (TLAB). Append the letter k or K to
indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or <br>
G to indicate gigabytes. If this option is set to 0, then
the JVM chooses the initial size automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows how
to set the initial TLAB size to 512 KB:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:TLABSize=512k</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy <br>
Enables the use of adaptive generation sizing. This option
is enabled by default. To disable adaptive generation
sizing, specify -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy and <br>
set the size of the memory allocation pool explicitly (see
the -XX:SurvivorRatio option).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly
<br>
Enables the use of the occupancy value as the only criterion
for initiating the CMS collector. By default, this option is
disabled and other criteria may be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC <br>
Enables the use of the CMS garbage collector for the old
generation. Oracle recommends that you use the CMS garbage
collector when application latency <br>
requirements cannot be met by the throughput
(-XX:+UseParallelGC) garbage collector. The G1 garbage
collector (-XX:+UseG1GC) is another alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, this option is
disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on
the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM. When
this option <br>
is enabled, the -XX:+UseParNewGC option is automatically set
and you should not disable it, because the following
combination of options has been deprecated in <br>
JDK 8: -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:-UseParNewGC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseG1GC <br>
Enables the use of the garbage-first (G1) garbage collector.
It is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for
multiprocessor machines with a large amount <br>
of RAM. It meets GC pause time goals with high probability,
while maintaining good throughput. The G1 collector is
recommended for applications requiring large <br>
heaps (sizes of around 6 GB or larger) with limited GC
latency requirements (stable and predictable pause time
below 0.5 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, this option is
disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on
the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit <br>
Enables the use of a policy that limits the proportion of
time spent by the JVM on GC before an OutOfMemoryError
exception is thrown. This option is enabled, <br>
by default and the parallel GC will throw an
OutOfMemoryError if more than 98% of the total time is spent
on garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is <br>
recovered. When the heap is small, this feature can be used
to prevent applications from running for long periods of
time with little or no progress. To <br>
disable this option, specify -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseNUMA <br>
Enables performance optimization of an application on a
machine with nonuniform memory architecture (NUMA) by
increasing the application&rsquo;s use of lower latency <br>
memory. By default, this option is disabled and no
optimization for NUMA is made. The option is only available
when the parallel garbage collector is used <br>
(-XX:+UseParallelGC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseParallelGC <br>
Enables the use of the parallel scavenge garbage collector
(also known as the throughput collector) to improve the
performance of your application by <br>
leveraging multiple processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, this option is
disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on
the configuration of the machine and type of the JVM. If it
is enabled, <br>
then the -XX:+UseParallelOldGC option is automatically
enabled, unless you explicitly disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseParallelOldGC <br>
Enables the use of the parallel garbage collector for full
GCs. By default, this option is disabled. Enabling it
automatically enables the -XX:+UseParallelGC <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseParNewGC <br>
Enables the use of parallel threads for collection in the
young generation. By default, this option is disabled. It is
automatically enabled when you set the <br>
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option. Using the -XX:+UseParNewGC
option without the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option was
deprecated in JDK 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseSerialGC <br>
Enables the use of the serial garbage collector. This is
generally the best choice for small and simple applications
that do not require any special <br>
functionality from garbage collection. By default, this
option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically
based on the configuration of the machine <br>
and type of the JVM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseSHM <br>
On Linux, enables the JVM to use shared memory to setup
large pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see
&quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseStringDeduplication <br>
Enables string deduplication. By default, this option is
disabled. To use this option, you must enable the
garbage-first (G1) garbage collector. See the <br>
-XX:+UseG1GC option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String deduplication reduces the
memory footprint of String objects on the Java heap by
taking advantage of the fact that many String objects are
identical. <br>
Instead of each String object pointing to its own character
array, identical String objects can point to and share the
same character array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseTLAB <br>
Enables the use of thread-local allocation blocks (TLABs) in
the young generation space. This option is enabled by
default. To disable the use of TLABs, <br>
specify -XX:-UseTLAB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated and Removed Options
<br>
These options were included in the previous release, but
have since been considered unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xincgc <br>
Enables incremental garbage collection. This option was
deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xrunlibname <br>
Loads the specified debugging/profiling library. This option
was superseded by the -agentlib option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycle=percent
<br>
Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) between minor
collections that the concurrent collector is allowed to run.
This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no <br>
replacement, following the deprecation of the
-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycleMin=percent
<br>
Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) between minor
collections that is the lower bound for the duty cycle when
-XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing is enabled. This <br>
option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement,
following the deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode <br>
Enables the incremental mode for the CMS collector. This
option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, along
with other options that start with <br>
CMSIncremental.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CMSIncrementalOffset=percent
<br>
Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) by which the
incremental mode duty cycle is shifted to the right within
the period between minor collections. This <br>
option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement,
following the deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing <br>
Enables automatic adjustment of the incremental mode duty
cycle based on statistics collected while the JVM is
running. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 <br>
with no replacement, following the deprecation of the
-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CMSIncrementalSafetyFactor=percent
<br>
Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) used to add
conservatism when computing the duty cycle. This option was
deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, <br>
following the deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode
option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:CMSInitiatingPermOccupancyFraction=percent

in JDK 8 with no replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:MaxPermSize=size <br>
Sets the maximum permanent generation space size (in bytes).
This option was deprecated in JDK 8, and superseded by the
-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:PermSize=size <br>
Sets the space (in bytes) allocated to the permanent
generation that triggers a garbage collection if it is
exceeded. This option was deprecated un JDK 8, and <br>
superseded by the -XX:MetaspaceSize option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseSplitVerifier <br>
Enables splitting of the verification process. By default,
this option was enabled in the previous releases, and
verification was split into two phases: type <br>
referencing (performed by the compiler) and type checking
(performed by the JVM runtime). This option was deprecated
in JDK 8, and verification is now split by <br>
default without a way to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseStringCache <br>
Enables caching of commonly allocated strings. This option
was removed from JDK 8 with no replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE TUNING EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples show how to use experimental tuning
flags to either optimize throughput or to provide lower
response time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 1 Tuning for Higher
Throughput</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">java -d64 -server
-XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseLargePages -Xmn10g -Xms26g

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LARGE PAGES <br>
Also known as huge pages, large pages are memory pages that
are significantly larger than the standard memory page size
(which varies depending on the processor <br>
and operating system). Large pages optimize processor
Translation-Lookaside Buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Translation-Lookaside Buffer
(TLB) is a page translation cache that holds the
most-recently used virtual-to-physical address translations.
TLB is a scarce system <br>
resource. A TLB miss can be costly as the processor must
then read from the hierarchical page table, which may
require multiple memory accesses. By using a larger <br>
memory page size, a single TLB entry can represent a larger
memory range. There will be less pressure on TLB, and
memory-intensive applications may have better <br>
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, large pages page memory
can negatively affect system performance. For example, when
a large mount of memory is pinned by an application, it may
create a <br>
shortage of regular memory and cause excessive paging in
other applications and slow down the entire system. Also, a
system that has been up for a long time could <br>
produce excessive fragmentation, which could make it
impossible to reserve enough large page memory. When this
happens, either the OS or JVM reverts to using <br>
regular pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Large Pages Support <br>
Solaris and Linux support large pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris <br>
Solaris 9 and later include Multiple Page Size Support
(MPSS); no additional configuration is necessary. See <br>

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/overview/solaris9-features-scalability-135663.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux <br>
The 2.6 kernel supports large pages. Some vendors have
backported the code to their 2.4-based releases. To check if
your system can support large page memory, <br>
try the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge
<br>
HugePages_Total: 0 <br>
HugePages_Free: 0 <br>
Hugepagesize: 2048 kB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output shows the three
&quot;Huge&quot; variables, then your system can support
large page memory but it needs to be configured. If the
command prints nothing, <br>
then your system does not support large pages. To configure
the system to use large page memory, login as root, and then
follow these steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If you are using the option
-XX:+UseSHM (instead of -XX:+UseHugeTLBFS), then increase
the SHMMAX value. It must be larger than the Java heap size.

will make all the memory sharable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># echo 4294967295 &gt;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If you are using the option
-XX:+UseSHM or -XX:+UseHugeTLBFS, then specify the number of
large pages. In the following example, 3 GB of a 4 GB system
are <br>

2048kB, then 3 GB = 3 * 1024 MB = 3072 MB = 3072 * 1024 kB =
3145728 kB and 3145728 kB / 2048 kB = <br>

&acirc; Consequently, if you configure the nr_hugepages
parameter to the &acirc; <br>

The following exit values are typically returned by the
launcher when the launcher is called with the wrong
arguments, serious errors, or exceptions thrown by the <br>
JVM. However, a Java application may choose to return any
value by using the API call System.exit(exitValue). The
values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; 0: Successful
completion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;&cent; &gt;0: An error
