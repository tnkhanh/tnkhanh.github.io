<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cowsay/cowthink - configurable speaking/thinking cow (and a
bit more)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cowsay [-e eye_string] [-f cowfile] [-h] [-l] [-n] [-T
tongue_string] [-W column] [-bdgpstwy]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cowsay generates an ASCII picture of a cow saying something
provided by the user. If run with no arguments, it accepts
standard input, word-wraps the message <br>
given at about 40 columns, and prints the cow saying the
given message on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To aid in the use of arbitrary
messages with arbitrary whitespace, use the -n option. If it
is specified, the given message will not be word-wrapped.
This is <br>
possibly useful if you want to make the cow think or speak
in figlet(6). If -n is specified, there must not be any
command-line arguments left after all the <br>
switches have been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -W specifies roughly where
the message should be wrapped. The default is equivalent to
-W 40 i.e. wrap words at or before the 40th column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any command-line arguments
are left over after all switches have been processed, they
become the cow&rsquo;s message. The program will not accept
standard input for <br>
a message in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several provided modes
which change the appearance of the cow depending on its
particular emotional/physical state. The -b option initiates
Borg mode; <br>
-d causes the cow to appear dead; -g invokes greedy mode; -p
causes a state of paranoia to come over the cow; -s makes
the cow appear thoroughly stoned; -t yields <br>
a tired cow; -w is somewhat the opposite of -t, and
initiates wired mode; -y brings on the cow&rsquo;s youthful
appearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user may specify the -e
option to select the appearance of the cow&rsquo;s eyes, in
which case the first two characters of the argument string
eye_string will be <br>
used. The default eyes are &rsquo;oo&rsquo;. The tongue is
similarly configurable through -T and tongue_string; it must
be two characters and does not appear by default. <br>
However, it does appear in the &rsquo;dead&rsquo; and
&rsquo;stoned&rsquo; modes. Any configuration done by -e and
-T will be lost if one of the provided modes is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option specifies a
particular cow picture file
(&lsquo;&lsquo;cowfile&rsquo;&rsquo;) to use. If the cowfile
spec contains &rsquo;/&rsquo; then it will be interpreted as
a path relative to the <br>
current directory. Otherwise, cowsay will search the path
specified in the COWPATH environment variable. To list all
cowfiles on the current COWPATH, invoke <br>
cowsay with the -l switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is invoked as
cowthink then the cow will think its message instead of
saying it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COWFILE FORMAT <br>
A cowfile is made up of a simple block of perl(1) code,
which assigns a picture of a cow to the variable $the_cow.
Should you wish to customize the eyes or the <br>
tongue of the cow, then the variables $eyes and $tongue may
be used. The trail leading up to the cow&rsquo;s message
balloon is composed of the character(s) in the <br>
$thoughts variable. Any backslashes must be reduplicated to
prevent interpolation. The name of a cowfile should end with
.cow, otherwise it is assumed not to be <br>
a cowfile. Also, at-signs (&lsquo;&lsquo;@&rsquo;&rsquo;)
must be backslashed because that is what Perl 5 expects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WITH OLDER
VERSIONS <br>
What older versions? :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 3.x is fully
backward-compatible with 2.x versions. If you&rsquo;re still
using a 1.x version, consider upgrading. And tell me where
you got the older ver&acirc; <br>
sions, since I didn&rsquo;t exactly put them up for
world-wide access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Oh, just so you know, this
manual page documents version 3.03 of cowsay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The COWPATH environment variable, if present, will be used
to search for cowfiles. It contains a colon-separated list
of directories, much like PATH or MANPATH. <br>
It should always contain the /usr/share/cowsay/cows
directory, or at least a directory with a file called
default.cow in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/cowsay/cows holds a sample set of cowfiles. If
your COWPATH is not explicitly set, it automatically
contains this directory.</p>
